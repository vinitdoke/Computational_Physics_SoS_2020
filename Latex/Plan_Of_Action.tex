 {\large The objective of this endeavour is to get an idea of the roll of Computation in solving Physics problems. Computational Physics complements the areas of theory and experimentation in traditional scientific investigation. Final goal would be to apply the techniques to predict outcome by simulation of the physical phenomenon.

	\subitem Pandas
	\subitem Matplotlib
	\item Implementing Math through code:
	\subitem Integrals and Derivatives
	\subitem Solving Linear and Non-Linear Equations
	\subitem ODEs and PDEs
	\subitem etc.
	\item Monte-Carlo Simulations
	\item Application of the techniques learned so far
\end{enumerate}
