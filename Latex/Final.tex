\section{Final Remarks}
\subsection{Learning Outcomes}
Throughout the course of this learning project, I learnt various Numerical Methods to evaluate Maths Functions and implement them in code. I learnt various Data Visualisation techniques and libraries in Python, namely,NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly etc. \\
Along with this, I gained insight into various Physics Concepts. By simulating them, we stand to gain more intuition of their working and by readily adjusting their parameters, we can see their dependence on these parameters instantaneously. I believe this adds to another layer of interactive learning. \\

\subsection{Python Scripts on GitHub}
I have hosted various python scripts utilised in this report alongside the scripts that aren't shown here, on my GitHub profile :  \href{https://github.com/vinitdoke/Computational_Physics_SoS_2020}{https://github.com/vinitdoke/Computational\textunderscore Physics\textunderscore SoS\textunderscore2020}
